Welcome to PyProjectStructure's documentation!
==============================================

Our repository and documentation mainly consist of best practices and the correct ways to use proper python package structure and generic tools such as tox, flake8 and mypy. Using these tools alongside github actions and such tools is getting more complicated and requires 
an increasing number of config files and environments, we hope to make this less complicated and create a repo where people can gain insight from and learn how to write basic tests

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`install` the project.
